## Two open source search engines that I like

### [SearXNG](https://search.ononoki.org/)

[Documentation page](https://docs.searxng.org/)<br>
This is the search engine that I use when I'm not using Ecosia or Neeva. It's **full open source** and has public instances that can be found [here](https://searx.space/), or you can host your own.

### [Presearch](https://presearch.com/)

I have used this one, right now It isn't open source but should be in the future … It has his own **crypto** …
<br>

## Special search engines

### [Neeva](https://neeva.com/)

Account based **freemium** search engine with no ads and integrations with other apps.

### [You.com](https://you.com/)

Account featured **AI** search engine with no ads, **mode for code**, integrations with other apps and a lot more useful features.

### [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/)

Bing search engine but green with nice UI and they **plant trees**.
